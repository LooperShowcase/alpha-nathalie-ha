      Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish
      painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent
      most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of
      the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
      invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and
      for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among
      his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon
      (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of
      the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the
      Spanish Civil War. Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in
      his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood
      and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style
      changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas.
      After 1906, the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri Matisse
      motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful
      rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by
      critics as the leaders of modern art.[10][11][12][13]
